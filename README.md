Scryer 2.0
==========

Rails version of the Scryer FF search engine.

## Getting started

1) Use RVM to segment your gems. Otherwise, you'll just need Ruby 2.1
2) `rake db:create db:migrate` to create db and migrate
3) `rake scryer:import` to seed dataabse
4) `rails server` and you're off

## Roadmap

1) Multi-fandom support
2) DLP SSO auth
3) Saved searches
4) Percolated searches / updates
